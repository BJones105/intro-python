"My favorite food is Cheesecake, to make cheesecake theres simple instructions. Make a filling from cream cheese, eggs, sugar and vanilla. Then I like to make my crust from biscoff cookies and then bake it 55-70 minutes on 250 F* (121*C).For the lighter, darker-colored cheesecake, cook the cheesecake for 20 minutes at high heat, then turn off the oven and prop the door open with a wooden spoon for 10 minutes.A bain-marie, or water bath, is the preferred method for baking cheesecakes because it gently cooks the eggs in the filling."
