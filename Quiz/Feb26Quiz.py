# 1. What built-in function would you use if you wanted to print out data to a user?
#  print()

# 2. What built-in function would you use if you wanted a user to pass in daya to a program?
# input()

# 3. Explain what complexity and abstraction are
# Provide an example descrbing their relationship to one another
# You cannot use the following examples because they were shared in class; grocery/electronics store, car, phone.

'Complexity is the measure of resource intensive a program can be.'
'Abstraction is the process of hiding/masking complexity'

# 4. What does it mean when you encounter a syntax error?

'This error occurs when you are not using the proper grammar/ and or language rules of python'

# 5. What is a variable? Provide an example of  variable in code.
# A variable is a container for data.
'Container for data.'
name = 'Brandon'
password=

'Brandon'
30
30.00
True
()
{}
[]

# 6. Write a function in Python that when called will print out your name.

def whatsyourname():
    name =input('Brandon: ')
    print(name)
    age = input('18')
    print(age)
    print('hi my name is 'Brandon', and my age is '18'')

# 7. What is a function definition and a function call?
'Function Definition -> Instructions that will only run when called.'

# 8. Describe what each symbol means?
 # = // signal equal
'Single equal sign = assignment'
career = 'engineer'
score = 60

# = // singal equal
'Single equal sign = assignemnts'
career = 'engineer'
score = 60

# == //

# ! // exclamation equal
'Comparison operator, we use it to compare if values are the same'

#9 What will the output for the following code block be?
listOne = [20, 40, 60, 80]
listTwo = [20, 40, 60, 80]

print (listOne == listTwo)

'True = both lists are the same'

# 11. Create the following python lists and incude the following data types for each list:
bookBagItemPrice = [1.00, 2.00, 3.00, .50]

# 12. What are the Three (3) naming formats we use for naming variables
'camelCase - The first letter in the first word is lowercase, but every new word after is uppercased.'
'PascalCase - every word is uppercased.'
'snake_case - every word is seperated with an underscore'

# 13. Provide a coding scenario where you would use a comparison


var1 = 1
var2 = 2
var3 = "3"
