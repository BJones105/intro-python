# Q : You have been hired as a software engineer to develop a gym membership system. Your program needs to verify two (2) things; if the user is a member of the gym, AND  if the user has the gold membership tier, which allows the user to have access to the swimming pool.  What your client would like to happen is that when a user is a member and also has the gold membership they should be able to use the pool. Which python operator would you use in this situation? Explain why
# A : I'd use Relational Python Operator for a gym membership. Relational shows a connection between one thing and another thing, this would show a connection to your card being a member and having the gold membership tier on your car allowing you to have access to all the things that come with it.

# Q : # 6. You have been hired as a software engineer to develop a simple payment system for a companys webstore. Your assignment is to create a cart system where the prices of all the items are added together and then deducts a 20% discount at checkout. Which python operator would you use in this situation? Explain why. 
# A : I'd use the Artihmatic Python Operator for a discount software for a store. I'd use Arithmatic due to its math like structure, using multiple variables like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This would give it the 20% discount a breeze by automatically giving what you buy the discount immedietely and helping with the hassle.

# Q : # 7. You have been hired as an engineer to develop a student badge system. Your client would like to have a system where when a student swipes their badge, the ID number on the badge is compared to the ID number in the database. If the ID numbers match and are the same the student can come in, if it does not match, they cannot enter. Which python operator would you use in this situation? Explain why
# A : Last but not least I'd use the Assignment Python Operator for this task. This would use its equal sign feature to use. Everytime your student badge equaled to the system you would be allowed to go into the building but if it didn't equal what was in the system you would be denied.
