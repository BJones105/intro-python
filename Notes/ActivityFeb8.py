# Using the tool's we've learned in class up to this point, create a block of code that will return a value.
# (You can use variables, data types, operators, etc)

# 1. Create a block of code that uses the any of the arithmetic operators then print out the result.
# A : 

# input always transforms the data into strings
input('give me data')
print('printing out data')
print(54 + 68)
number_A = 54
number_B = 68
print(number_A + number_B)

# 2. Create a block of code that uses the and operator and then print out the result.
# A :

isMember = True
goldTier = True

print(isMember and goldTier)


# 3. Create a block or code that uses the NOT EQUAL operator and then use then print out the result.
# A : 
fruit_A = 'apples'
fruit_B = 'oranges'

print(fruit_A == fruit_B)

age = 20 
age!= 18: print(you are not 18 years old)

# 1 = (equal sign) = assignment
# 2 == (double equal sign) = comparing if values are the same
# 3 != (explanation + equal sign) = comparing if values are NOT the same.
