# Using the tool's we've learned in class up to this point, create a block of code that will return a value.
# (You can use variables, data types, operators, etc)

# 1. Create a block of code that uses the any of the arithmetic operators then print out the result.
# A : 

# input always transforms the data into strings
input('give me data')
print('printing out data')
print(54 + 68)
number_A = 54
number_B = 68
print(number_A + number_B)

# 2. Create a block of code that uses the and operator and then print out the result.
# A :
bankAccount = 100.00

deposit = float(input('how much would you likee to deposit?'))
                
print('your bank total')
print(bankAccount + deposit)
